# Medical Research Knowledge Graph Schema

## Overview

This schema is designed to support clinical decision-making by representing medical knowledge extracted from research papers. The graph enables multi-hop reasoning, contradiction detection, and evidence-based inference.

## Design Principles

1. **Clinical utility first** - Schema supports queries doctors actually ask
2. **Provenance always** - Every relationship traces back to source papers
3. **Handle uncertainty** - Represent confidence, contradictions, and evolution over time
4. **Standards-based** - Use UMLS, MeSH, and other medical ontologies for entity IDs
5. **Scalable** - Can grow from thousands to millions of papers

## Provenance and Evidence

Every medical relationship edge MUST include:

```
- source_papers: [list of PMC IDs supporting this relationship]
- evidence_count: Number of papers supporting
- contradicting_papers: [list of PMC IDs contradicting]
- first_reported: Date first observed
- last_updated: Most recent evidence
- confidence: Calculated from evidence strength
```

## Confidence Scoring

Confidence for each relationship calculated from:

1. **Number of supporting papers** - More evidence = higher confidence
2. **Study quality** - RCTs weighted higher than case reports
3. **Sample size** - Larger studies weighted higher
4. **Recency** - More recent papers weighted slightly higher
5. **Contradictions** - Presence reduces confidence
6. **Journal impact** - Higher impact journals weighted slightly higher

Formula:
```
confidence = base_score * quality_multiplier * (1 - contradiction_penalty)

where:
- base_score = min(evidence_count / 10, 0.8)  # Caps at 0.8 with 10+ papers
- quality_multiplier = weighted average of study types
- contradiction_penalty = contradicting_count / (evidence_count + contradicting_count)
```

## Handling Contradictions

When papers disagree:

1. **Preserve both relationships** - Don't delete contradicting evidence
2. **Link contradictions** - Add `contradicted_by` property
3. **Surface in queries** - Show users when evidence conflicts
4. **Track evolution** - Understanding may change over time

Example:
```
Drug A -[TREATS]-> Disease X
  source_papers: [PMC111, PMC222, PMC333]
  confidence: 0.75
  contradicted_by: [PMC444]  # One paper found no effect
```

## Temporal Representation

Medical knowledge evolves. Track this with:

```
Drug -[TREATS {valid_from: "2015", valid_to: "2020"}]-> Disease
  # Was considered treatment from 2015-2020

Drug -[TREATS {valid_from: "2020", valid_to: null}]-> Disease
  # New understanding starting 2020
```

## Example Graph Snippet

```

## Query Examples This Schema Enables

1. **"What treats breast cancer?"**
   ```
   MATCH (d:Drug)-[t:TREATS]->(disease:Disease {name: "Breast Cancer"})
   RETURN d.name, t.efficacy, t.source_papers
   ORDER BY t.confidence DESC
   ```

2. **"What are the risks associated with BRCA1 mutations?"**
   ```
   MATCH (g:Gene {symbol: "BRCA1"})-[r:INCREASES_RISK]->(d:Disease)
   RETURN d.name, r.risk_ratio, r.source_papers
   ORDER BY r.risk_ratio DESC
   ```

3. **"Are there contradictions about Drug X efficacy?"**
   ```
   MATCH (drug:Drug {name: "X"})-[t:TREATS]->(d:Disease)
   WHERE size(t.contradicted_by) > 0
   RETURN d.name, t.source_papers, t.contradicted_by
   ```

4. **"What pathways is BRCA1 involved in?"**
   ```
   MATCH (g:Gene {symbol: "BRCA1"})-[:ENCODES]->(p:Protein)
         -[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(path:Pathway)
   RETURN path.name, path.category
   ```

## Implementation Notes

### Graph Database Choice

**Option 1: Amazon Neptune**
- Pros: AWS native, fully managed, supports Gremlin/SPARQL
- Cons: More expensive, separate service from OpenSearch

**Option 2: Neo4j**
- Pros: Mature, excellent Cypher query language, strong community
- Cons: Need to manage separately, extra infrastructure

**Option 3: OpenSearch with graph queries**
- Pros: Already using OpenSearch, fewer moving parts
- Cons: Graph capabilities less mature than dedicated graph DBs

**Recommendation:** Start with Neo4j for development (can run locally), migrate to Neptune for production if needed.

### Entity Normalization Strategy

1. **Primary entities** (Disease, Gene, Drug) get canonical IDs from:
   - UMLS (diseases, symptoms, general medical concepts)
   - HGNC (genes)
   - RxNorm (drugs)
   - UniProt (proteins)

2. **Entity linking pipeline:**
   ```
   Extracted text → NER → Candidate entities →
   Entity linking → Canonical ID → Graph node
   ```

3. **Handle synonyms:**
   - Store all variants in `synonyms` property
   - Create index on synonyms for fast lookup
   - Map during extraction phase

### Incremental Building

1. **Start simple** - Just diseases, genes, drugs, basic relationships
2. **Add complexity** - Proteins, pathways, biomarkers
3. **Add metadata** - Authors, trials, more detailed provenance
4. **Refine confidence** - Better scoring as you learn what works

## Next Steps

1. Choose graph database platform
2. Design entity extraction pipeline
3. Build relationship extraction logic
4. Create confidence scoring system
5. Integrate with existing vector search

"""
This schema uses strongly-typed entity classes (Disease, Gene, Drug, Protein, etc.) as the
canonical representation for all entities in the knowledge graph. Each typed entity includes:
- Type-specific ID fields (e.g., umls_id for Disease, hgnc_id for Gene)
- Pre-computed embeddings (Titan v2, PubMedBERT) for semantic search
- Provenance metadata (source, created_at) for tracking entity origins
This approach provides better type safety and validation compared to a generic entity class.
